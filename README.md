# tumblr-webpage

This is my first personal project. I plan to design an aesthetically pleasing webpage for a tumblr blog allowing me to document my progress with coding. My first post is designated to be a guide through discrete structures-- a class that I start next week, so I'm getting things up and running before classes start again.
